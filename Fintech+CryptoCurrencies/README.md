This repository contains two folders, one contains the Presentation, including the LaTeX source (the viewable file is Presentation.pdf), the other contains a number of examples of smart contracts. Please feel free to use this repository as you see fit, as long as you attribute the source.

Make sure to check out the wiki page, we have a bunch of material for developing smart contracts in there.
