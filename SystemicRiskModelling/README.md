These slides are part of a short-course given at Hanken School of Economics 2018. The same license as for all my teaching slides applies. I am most grateful to Tina Koziol, Allan Davids, Jesper Riedler, Suraj Shekhar, and Daniel Opolot for outstanding help with the slides. All remaining errors are my own.
